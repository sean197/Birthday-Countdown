Birthday Countdown

This was an expewrimental web app which counts the days left until your birthday. 
This app wascreated using vanilla javascript and used to further consolidate my knowledge of Date and Times 
ad well as using external time sources such as data-fns

This was a web application called birthday countdown which showed tou how many days it was until one's birthday.

The way the vanilla JavaScript app works is the user types in their next birthday and the app displays how many days it would be till 
the users birthday.

The app used the date-fns as an external time source.
